Level Eight
Fairy 1: 'Great Monarch, we estimate that he is near the edges of Finity Forest.'
Finity: 'So the little twerp thinks he is a big shot, huh?'
Goblin 1: 'He'll know better soon enough!  I'll destroy him myself!'
Finity: 'NO!'
***Finity stares around the room...
Finity: 'I have set a trap for him.  While he has been attacking me, I have learned about him...'
Fairy 1: 'What have you learned, Great Monarch?'
Finity: 'I have sent some of my greatest warriors to his home.  Should he survive, I have a special someone to meet him at Bagolth...'

Finity: '...while I plan my next move...'

Level Twelve
Helper Person: 'Have I ever told you about that time I was in a band? I was living back in LoBo Jaimes and-'
Hero: 'No time for that now.'
Hero: 'I overheard one of those trolls back there mention something about a 'shortcut to work' called Rainy City.'
Hero: '...and I'm willing to bet we can get to Finity faster!'
Helper Person: 'Are you sure it is not a trap?'
Hero: 'I've got to try, but it will be danagerous...'

***...it is Helper Person!
Hero: 'Helper Person, I am so glad to see you!  You were right about the trap!'
Helper Person: 'I had a feeling you might need me, so I continued ahead.'
Helper Person: 'Since all of Finity's minions were distracted by you, I was able to sneak into the Labrynth.'
Hero: 'That is fantastic!  What did you see?'
Helper Person: 'I couldn't believe my eyes, but I saw Grick and Trevor in there with her!'
Hero: 'How can that be possible?  I defeated those two!'
Helper Person: 'It seems that she has created some sort of potion that can raise people from the dead...'
Hero: 'But if that is possible, what happened to Castor?'
Helper Person: 'She must have revived him by now...'
Helper Person: 'You must destroy her to destroy her minions and save the world!'
